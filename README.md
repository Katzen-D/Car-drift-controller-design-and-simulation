# 自动驾驶车辆的极限工况漂移控制器设计

本项目是博主毕设源码，毕业设计题目是：**自动驾驶车辆的极限工况漂移控制器设计**。欢迎批评指正，十分感谢！

首先说声抱歉，之前预计在答辩后将程序和论文全部开源上传。但很可惜，因为其中一部分工作组内需要继续研究，故还不能及时开源。加之由于时间匆忙，论文终稿中有不少错误也未来得及更正，很抱歉该工作不能如期开源。预计将在组内工作结束后，时间充裕的时候修改论文整理工作后再上传，敬请期待！

# Car Drift Controller Design and Simulation

Hi, this project is my graduation design. As you might imagine, it's based on the [Stanford Dynamic Design Lab](https://ddl.stanford.edu/)'s research project. My primary goal is to repeat this research and upload the code according to my understanding. 

Frankly, I really hope I can do more things and share more thoughts about this project. However, limited by time and my own ability, the final result may not be optimistic. As you have seen, my English is very poor. I'm so sorry for the above cons. 

At last, I would like to express my gratitude to the doctor---**Zhuqing Shi** and professor--- **Shuyou Yu** who guided me. Thank you!
